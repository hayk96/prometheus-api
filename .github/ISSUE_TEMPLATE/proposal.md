### What problem are you trying to solve?
* _Introduce the problem statement here. This might be well-defined ('we need to tweak the parameter of a rule from X to Y to help reduce a certain type of abuse')._
* _Focus on the underlying problem that needs to be solved, as opposed to jumping to how you will solve it._

### Why should we solve it?
* _Why is this an important problem for us to solve?_  
* _Is it a big enough problem to solve?_
* _Should we solve it now, or later?_
* _Provide specific data (quantitative or qualitative) wherever possible._

### How do you propose to solve it?
* _Add details of your proposed change. This can be high-level as psuedocode and sketches of the architecture, or as low-level as Protocol Buffer and interface definitions. Decide what the context of the proposal is, and write appropriately._
* _Be explicit about what you are optimising for in this proposed solution â€” for example, 'we need to hit this deadline, so we'll accept the tech debt this entails'._

### What other approaches did you consider?
* _In general, it's a red-flag if you haven't thought of a couple of different ways that you could approach the problem._
* _What does your proposed solution give you that these approaches don't?_
* _What are they optimising for that isn't appropriate in this case?_

### What could go wrong?
* _What risks does your proposed change entail?_
* _How will you mitigate them?_
